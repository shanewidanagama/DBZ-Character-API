# DBZ-character-API

The DBZ encyclopedia allows users to access information about their favorite
  characters. This API can do multiple things (3 to be exact). It can list all there is to know about a character.
   It can tell which alien race your favorite character belongs to. It can even tell you who's stronger than who!
