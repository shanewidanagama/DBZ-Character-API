# DBZ-character-API

Created a simple DBZ encyclopedia API allows users to access information about their favorite Dragon Ball Z
  characters. This API can do multiple things. It can list all there is to know about a character.
   It can tell which alien race your favorite character belongs to. It can even tell you who's stronger than who!
   
   Used PHP, HTML, and CSS
